# Churn_Modeling
This project aims at predicting customers in a bank whether they will be exiting in future or not. This churn modelling can play an important role for the bank. It will give advantage to the holders of the bank to know whether a 
customer will leave the bank in future or not. This dataset was taken from kaggle and there are numerous features both categorical and continuous. In this project I have created an Artificial Neural Network with Keras using different parameters and predicted the result.
